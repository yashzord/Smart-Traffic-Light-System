## Overview
**Smart Traffic Light System (STLS)** is a comprehensive AI-driven solution aimed at optimizing traffic flow in urban environments. By leveraging city-wide cameras, advanced AI algorithms, and community reports, STLS dynamically adjusts traffic light patterns to minimize congestion and improve travel times for the majority of commuters.

---

## Objective
Our aim is to **revolutionize urban traffic management** by:
- Employing AI and camera technology to monitor and analyze real-time traffic data.  
- Adjusting traffic signals based on dynamic weights and predictions from AI algorithms.  
- Providing an interface for users to report incidents and excessive wait times, thereby enhancing the systemâ€™s adaptability.

---

## Scope
The **technical** scope includes:
- **AI development** for real-time analysis and decision-making.  
- **Camera and sensor integration** across the city.  
- **User reporting interface** (mobile and/or web) to gather community feedback.  

The **business** scope covers:
- **Scalability** to different urban environments.  
- **Integration** with existing city infrastructure.  
- **Sustainability** and cost-effectiveness for city governments.

---

## Reason
Urban traffic congestion results in:
- Billions of dollars lost annually in productivity.  
- Excess fuel consumption and higher carbon emissions.  
- Commuters spending up to 51 extra hours a year stuck in traffic (U.S. figures).  

By prioritizing the **Smart Traffic Light System**, municipalities can address these critical issues, reduce congestion, and increase overall economic and environmental efficiency.

---

## Deliverables
At project completion, we will deliver:
1. **AI-driven traffic control system** covering major intersections.  
2. A **network of IoT devices** (cameras, sensors) feeding real-time data.  
3. **User/Civilian Reporting Interface** (mobile or web) enabling community engagement.  
4. **Administrative Dashboard** for city officials to monitor and manage traffic signals.  

---

## Measuring Success
Key metrics to determine project success:
1. **Reduction in average wait times** at major intersections.  
2. **Lower congestion** during peak hours as measured by traffic flow data.  
3. **User engagement** via incident reporting and feedback (adoption rates, satisfaction levels).
